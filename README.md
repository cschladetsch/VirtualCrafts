# VirtualCrafts
Virtual RC system, including Quads, Fixed-wing planes, and Transmitter apps on mobile phones.

There will be a common framework made, to support creation of:

* Quadcopters
* Tricopters
* Helicopters
* Fixed-wing 2,3 and 4-channel planes

## Transmitter
The Transmitter is a separate app designed to work on either Android or iOS. 

It binds to the virtual crafts and after that supplies input data to the flight controllers on them.

## Technical Risks
This is a non-trivial project that will take a few months at least.

I have some basic support, and a simple quad and fixed-wing model.

# Road Map

1. Get Transmitter working
1. Get Working Quad
1. Get Working Fixed-Wing
1. Get Working Car
